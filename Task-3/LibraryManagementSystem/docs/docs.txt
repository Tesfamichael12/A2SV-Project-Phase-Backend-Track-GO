Library Management System


Overview
This is a simple console-based library management system written in Go. Users must register with a username and password; member IDs are assigned automatically. The system uses structs, interfaces, methods, slices, and maps to manage books and members.

Features
- Add a new book
- Remove an existing book (only if not borrowed)
- Borrow a book (if available)
- Return a borrowed book
- List all available books
- List all books borrowed by a member
